A really basic (boilerplate) code for Human_detection using OpenCV.
The script [`human_detector.py`](human_detector.py) is the Wrapper around, `HOG-SVM` model already implemented in OpenCV.

## Note

The aim of the script is not Accuracy, but ease of usability.


## Dependency

- OpenCV
- Numpy
- Imutils
- Jupyter
and associated packages.

These are summarised in `requirement.txt`

## Setup

1. A virtual environment (recommended)
1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
1. Open the [Jupyter Notebook](human_detector.ipynb).
1. The Steps, details and guidelines can be found in comments.
